Code for 100K Splicing Project: "A systematic analysis of splicing variants identifies new diagnoses in the 100,000 Genomes Project."

The "branchpoints", "candidate_variants", and "near_splice" folders have the same subfolder structure:
	|--- data
	|--- outputs
	|--- plotting
	|--- scripts
	|--- stats

A text file in each folder describes the contents of the respective "data" folder.
The ./scripts folder contains all script necessary to produce the relevant data and statistics.
The commands in scripts/run_all.sh will run all of the scripts in this folder in the correct order.
The plotting folder contains scripts to generate plots.
